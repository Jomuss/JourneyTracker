# JourneyTracker


Journey Tracker is a mobile platform designed for people at similar skill levels to congregate and talk about their struggles and successes, sharing their personal journey.

The major motivaiton behind Journey Tracker is the belief that experts in anything, while extremely knowledgable, can sometimes struggle to relate to someone who is currently in the process of learning. It can be helpful to connect with people currently going through the same learning process as you, as it gives a new perspective on the issues you are facing.
